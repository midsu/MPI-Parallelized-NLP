## Project 2: Programming using MPI
An algorithm that uses MPI commands to solve a problem

## Directions:

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash

mpiexec -n 4 python3 project.py

```

## Introduction
For this project we choose a topic covered in class or similar to the topics that was provided as samples and designed an algorithm that uses MPI commands to solve a problem. You will describe the algorithm using clear pseudocode and implement your algorithms in python, compile, test it, and submit BOTH the report (as a PDF file) and the programs. We do not care about the efficiency of the algorithms at this point.
